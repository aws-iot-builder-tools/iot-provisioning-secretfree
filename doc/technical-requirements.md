# Technical Requirements

Beyond having an AWS account with an IAM login having Administrative
privilege (IAM objects will be created), the local workstation must
have the following installed.

1. You must be on a relatively modern BSD or GNU/Linux based
   system. If you are running a host with Microsoft Windows, you can
   run the commands from an Amazon EC2 instance.
2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. Docker 19.
4. Python 3.6 or 3.7.
5. OpenSSL (0.9.8zh).
6. Common shell utilities (fileutils, binutils, etc.)
