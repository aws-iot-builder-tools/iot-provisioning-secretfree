# Start prototyping

This **start prototyping** document helps you setup and verify
AWS Cloud configuration.

Before starting, check [technical requirements](technical-requirements.md).

Follow these steps.

1. [Implement the AWS Cloud system](cloud-install.md). In this step,
   you will install AWS Cloud configuration that facilitates the
   provisioning.
2. [Verify the AWS Cloud system](cloud-verify.md). In this step, you
   will upload a single device-id and device-pubkey pair to Amazon
   DynamoDB and verify that you receive a certificate that connects to
   AWS IoT Core.
